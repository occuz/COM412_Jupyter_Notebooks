KNN is extremely easy to implement in its most basic form, and yet performs quite complex classification tasks. It is a lazy learning algorithm since it doesn't have a specialized training phase. Rather, it uses all of the data for training while classifying a new data point or instance. KNN is a non-parametric learning algorithm, which means that it doesn't assume anything about the underlying data. This is an extremely useful feature since most of the real world data doesn't really follow any theoretical assumption e.g. linear-separability, uniform distribution, etc.\n","   \n","## Pros\n","\n","- It is extremely easy to implement.\n","- As said earlier, it is lazy learning algorithm and therefore requires no training prior to making real time predictions. This makes the KNN algorithm much faster than other algorithms that require training e.g SVM, linear regression, etc.\n","- Since the algorithm requires no training before making predictions, new data can be added seamlessly.\n","- There are only two parameters required to implement KNN i.e. the value of K and the distance function (e.g. Euclidean or Manhattan etc.)\n","\n","## Cons\n","\n","- The KNN algorithm doesn't work well with high dimensional data because with large number of dimensions, it becomes difficult for the algorithm to calculate distance in each dimension.\n","- The KNN algorithm has a high prediction cost for large datasets. This is because in large datasets the cost of calculating distance between new point and each existing point becomes higher.\n","- Finally, the KNN algorithm doesn't work well with categorical features since it is difficult to find the distance between dimensions with categorical features."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"cYtx4w0jhiwZ"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Importing necessary libraries\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as
